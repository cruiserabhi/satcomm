/**
 * @file       DataFilterManager.hpp
 *
 * @brief      It manages Data Restrict Filters. When the filters are enabled, only the data packets
 *             matching the filters will be sent by the modem to the apps processor. All other
 *             packets will be queued by the modem till the filters are disabled. One application
 *             of these filters is for power save purposes. When the apps processor goes to sleep,
 *             spurious incoming packets from the network could unnecessarily wake it up thereby
 *             draining the power. The DataFilterManager allows one to add filters only for
 *             necessary/important/wakeup packets. After adding these filters, one could enable them
 *             just before the apps processor goes to sleep. The apps proc will now be woken up only
 *             if a packet that we care about is received by the modem.
