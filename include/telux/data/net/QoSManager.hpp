/**
 * @brief The QoS Manager class provides a set of APIs related to Quality of Service (QoS) for the
 * various data flows that flow via the NAD. Its purpose is to manage aspects like assigning
 * priority to the data flow, limiting the bandwidth of each flow relative to other flows, etc.
 *
 *    - Data Flow Identification @ref ITrafficFilter :
 *          - Data flows can be identified using various parameters from network layers 2, 3, and 4.
 *          - These parameters include: Five-tuple (source and destination IP addresses, source and
 *            destination port numbers, and IP protocol), VLAN ID, and PCP number (assigned to VLAN
 *            using @ref IVlanManager::createVlan) etc.
 *          - A data flow is described using a Traffic Filter @ref ITrafficFilter. A Traffic Filter
 *            is created using @ref TrafficFilterBuilder.
 *
 *    - Traffic Classes:
 *          - A traffic class is similar to a class in Linux traffic control (tc).
 *          - Each traffic class can have multiple associated data flows.
 *          - Each traffic class is identified by a unique ID. Traffic class IDs start from 0
 *            (highest priority) and go up to the maximum allowed traffic class.
 *          - Lower values correspond to higher priorities.
 *
 *    - Traffic bandwidth configuration:
 *          - One can specify constraints/limits on the bandwidth that each Traffic class is allowed
 *            using @ref createTrafficClass.
 *          - Currently this is used to configure the bandwidth on the traffic egressing the NAD via
 *            the Eth link, to other devices/ECUs.
 *
 *    - Creating QoS filter:
 *          - Users assign relative priorities between data flows and QoS filter by associating a
 *            data flow with a traffic class.
 *          - This association is done by @ref QoSFilterConfig.
 *          - Once a QoS filter config is created, it needs to be added to the system using
 *            @ref addQoSFilter. Adding a filter returns a handle. This handle can then be used to
 *            perform operations like deleting a QoS filter @ref deleteQosFilter.
 *
 *    - QoS filters are added to different modules based on the data path assigned to the traffic
 *      class. These can be Ethernet (Eth), IP Accelerator (IPA), modem.

     * allows users to assign relative priorities between data flows and build QoS filters. The
     * traffic filter is constructed using @ref TrafficFilterBuilder.
     *
     * - While building a TrafficFilter, direction is a mandatory parameter that must be set via the
     *   @ref TrafficFilterBuilder. Other parameters are optional.
     *
     * - The IPv4 ( @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setIPv4Address ),
     *   IPv6 ( @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setIPv6Address ), and
     *   VLAN ( @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setVlanList ) parameters of the traffic filter are
     *   mutually exclusive and only one type of attribute can be set out of these for a given
     *   filter. For example, if a filter is needed for both IPv4 and IPv6, then two filters will
     *   have to be added one for IPv4 and the other for IPv6.
     *
     * - Prioritization is possible in the uplink and downlink direction. However, prioritization in
     *   the modem is possible only in the uplink direction.Modem uses 5 tuple information to do
     *   prioritization. To do prioritization in the modem the following parameters are mandatory
     *   when creating traffic filters.
     *   - Source IP @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setIPv4Address(ipv4Addr, FieldType::SOURCE) or
     *     @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setIPv6Address(ipv6Addr, FieldType::SOURCE)
     *   - Protocol @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setIPProtocol

     *     @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setIPv6Address(ipv6Addr, FieldType::DESTINATION) or
     *     @ref TrafficFilterBuilder::setPort(port, FieldType::DESTINATION)
     *
     * - PCP associated with a QoS filter will be used for prioritization with the Eth module.
     *   - The traffic class has a one-to-one mapping with PCP, i.e., only one PCP-based traffic
     *     filter can be associated with a traffic class.
     *   - A traffic class with a higher priority PCP should be associated with a traffic class of
     *     high priority. Note: A higher value PCP (for example 7) is considered the highest
     *     priority whereas a lower value traffic class (for example 0) is considered as highest
     *     priority.
     *      - For example, traffic class 0 (highest priority) can be associated with PCP 7 (highest
     *        priority).
     *   - PCP 0 is reserved and should not be used by clients.
     *   - To ensure prioritization of data flows originating from clients running on the NAD
     *     application processor destined towards the Ethernet module, VLAN needs to be used and the
     *     VLAN needs to be associated with a PCP value with the corresponding priority. To create
     *     the VLAN refer to @ref IVlanManager::createVlan and to associate the PCP value refer to
     *     @ref VlanConfig::priority parameter.
     *
     * Adding a filter returns a handle. This handle can then be used to perform operations like
