/**
 * @file   KeepAliveManager.hpp
 * @brief  KeepAliveManager provides APIs to configure TCP keep-alive offloading.
 *
 *         TCP keep-alive offloading can be used by TCP clients on the AP/EAP to offload
 *         the sending of TCP keep-alive messages to the modem. This allows the client to
 *         keep the TCP connection valid while the AP/EAP is suspended.
 *
 *         TCP keep-alive offloading is supported in two modes: normal mode and monitor mode.
 *
 *         - Normal mode: Requires the client to specify the TCP session parameters
 *           (recvNext, recvWindow, sendNext, sendWindow)
 *         - Monitor mode: Allows the client to configure a packet monitor on the modem to allow
 *           the modem to learn the TCP session parameters used to set up TCP-keepAlive offloading.
 *
 *           The monitor allows the client to use TCP-keepAlive offloading without the need to
 *           retreive the TCP session parameters from the AP/EAP.
 *         @note The supported configuration is the TCP client running within the MDM and the TCP
 *         server operating outside of the MDM.
