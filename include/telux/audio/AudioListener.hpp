 * callbacks will not be called anymore. For example, if stream->setVolume(callback) is
 * called and SSR occurs then the 'callback' will be never invoked.
 *
 * All the stream objects (IAudioVoiceStream/IAudioPlayStream/IAudioCaptureStream/
 * IAudioLoopbackStream/IAudioToneGeneratorStream) becomes invalid and should not be
 * used after SSR. When SSR occurs, the implementation cleans up all resources associated
 * with streams that were created before SSR. Application should create new audio stream.
