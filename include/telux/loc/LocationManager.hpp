 *
 * Usage of NMEA Sentences:
 *
 * NMEA updates can be received by either:
 * a) Setting the
 * @ref telux::loc::GnssReportType::NMEA bit in the reportMask passed as a paramter to
 * this API and receive the sentences via @ref ILocationListener::onGnssNmeaInfo.
 * b) Setting the
 * @ref telux::loc::GnssReportType::ENGINE_NMEA bit in the reportMask passed as a paramter to
 * this API and receive the sentences via @ref ILocationListener::onEngineNmeaInfo.
 *
 * When clients set the GnssReportType::NMEA bit in the reportMask passed as a parameter
 * to @ref ILocationManager::startDetailedEngineReports, the NMEA sentences are always
 * generated by FUSED engine and are received via @ref ILocationListener::onGnssNmeaInfo.
 * Clients can also configure the NMEA sentences to be received via
 * @ref ILocationConfigurator::configureNmea.
 *
 * Additionally, clients have the ability to receive NMEA sentences for a specific
 * engineType mask via @ref ILocationListener::onEngineNmeaInfo.
 * To receive the NMEA updates for a specific engine type, clients should configure the
 * NMEA sentences for the specific engineType mask via @ref ILocationConfigurator::configureNmea.
 * Next, while invoking @ref ILocationManager::startDetailedEngineReports, clients need to set the
 * @ref telux::loc::GnssReportType::ENGINE_NMEA bit in the reportMask.
 * The engineType mask passed as a parameter to this API should at least contain the
 * engines configured via the @ref ILocationConfigurator::configureNmea API.
 * The intended NMEA updates will be received via @ref ILocationListener::onEngineNmeaInfo.
 *
 * Understanding with an example -
 * Client configures a few NMEA sentences via @ref ILocationConfigurator::configureNmea
 * with the engineType mask set as PPE and FUSED. [Fused engine is always considered as set
 * even if the client does not explicitly specify it.]
 * Client invokes detailedEngineReports via @ref ILocationManager::startDetailedEngineReports
 * by setting the @ref telux::loc::GnssReportType::NMEA bit in the reportMask and
 * setting the engineType mask as just PPE.
 * Since both the engineType masks contain PPE, the NMEA updates generated by PPE will be received
 * via @ref ILocationListener::onEngineNmeaInfo. However, NMEA updates from FUSED engine will not be
 * received since the engine mask for this API is set to only PPE.
 *
 * If client sets the engineType mask as SPE while trying to configure NMEA sentences and sets
 * engineType mask as PPE while trying to invoke the detailed engine reports, no NMEA updates will
 * be received via @ref ILocationListener::onEngineNmeaInfo since there is NO intersection between
 * the 2 masks.
 *
 * On platforms with Access control enabled, caller needs to have TELUX_LOC_DATA permission to
 * invoke this API successfully.
 *
 * @param [in] interval - Minimum time interval between two consecutive
 * reports in milliseconds. The interval only controls the rate at which the PVT reports are
 * delivered to clients via @ref ILocationListener::onDetailedEngineLocationUpdate.
 * The rate at which other report types are delivered are based on a platform configuration.
 *
 * E.g. If minInterval is 1000 milliseconds, reports will be provided with a
 * periodicity of 1 second or more depending on the number of applications
 * listening to location updates.
 *
 * @param [in] engineType - The type of engine requested for fixes such as
 * SPE or PPE or FUSED. The FUSED includes all the engines that are running to
 * generate the fixes such as reports from SPE, PPE and DRE.
 *
 * @param [in] callback - Optional callback to get the response of set
 *             minimum interval for reports.
 *
 * @param [in] reportMask - Optional field to specify which reports a client is interested in.
 *                          By default all the reports will be enabled.
 *
 * @returns Status of startDetailedEngineReports i.e. success or suitable status
 * code.
