 *
 *   A client running on the MDM can collect logs from the whole MDM device or from the
 *   specific  MDM peripheral(s).
 *
 *   Consider a fusion architecture where an EAP is connected to the MDM SoC via some interconnect

 *   from the whole MDM device or from the specific MDM peripheral(s). It cannot collect logs from

 *   it can collect logs from the whole MDM device, from the whole EAP device or from the specific
 *   peripheral(s) on EAP. Currently, EAP is not supported.
 *
 * - Granularity, on top of the log source, logs can be further narrowed down to be of specific
 *   type like message/event/F3 etc. using a mask file.
 *
 * - Decoding: When using file method, logs are in a propriety format and can be decoded through
 *   QXDM to read them in a plain text format. For callback method, they are in raw format.
 *
 * - Concurrency: Two or more processes can not collect logs from the same peripheral. A process
 *   can have only one session. A session is started with startLogCollection() and stopped with
 *   stopLogCollection(). The file and callback methods are mutually exclusive.
