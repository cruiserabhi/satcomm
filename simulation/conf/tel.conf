### Logger settings ###

# CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL, FILE_LOG_LEVEL and SYSLOG_LOG_LEVEL
# specify the threshold for log messages

# CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL enables console logging
# FILE_LOG_LEVEL enables file based logging. Default path LOG_FILE_PATH.
# SYSLOG_LOG_LEVEL enabled syslog logging.
#
# Possible LOG_LEVEL values are NONE, PERF, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
# NONE - No logging.
# PERF - Prints messages with nanoseconds precision timestamp.
# ERROR - Very minimal logging.Prints perf and error messages only.
# WARNING - Prints perf, error and warning messages.
# INFO - Prints perf, errors, warning and information messages.
# DEBUG - Full logging including debug messages.It is intended for debugging purposes only.

CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Based on the product requirement, above mapping can be overridden by defining NUM_DEVICES,
# DEVICE_TYPE, DEVICE_DIR and either AHAL_DEVICE_TYPE or APAL_DEVICE_TYPE as applicable for
# the given software product. To define, simply uncomment these parameters in this file and
# remove leading/trailing spaces. All values must be comma separated without spaces.
#
# 1. Define number of audio devices to map (for example, 10).
#NUM_DEVICES=10
# 2. Define telsdk audio device. These numbers are mentioned in telux::audio::DeviceType enum.
#DEVICE_TYPE=1,2,3,4,5,257,258,259,260,261
# 3. Define direction of the device. These numbers are mentioned in telux::audio::DeviceDirection
#    enum.
#DEVICE_DIR=1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2

# MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE specifies the maximum allowed size(in bytes) of the log file
# When the log file reaches its maximum size, it is saved as tel.log.backup.
# If the log file again reaches the max, it will be saved again overwriting the previous
# tel.log.backup file.
# So at a given time only one tel.log and tel.backup will exist in system.
# Default MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE is 5 Mega Bytes.

# LOG_FILE_PATH specifies the path of the log file
# Specifies the log file path, by default the path is, from where the application runs.

###Location filtering setting ###
# Used to decide if the position reports need to be filtered and

# based on the client requested intervals. By default, this setting is enabled.

###Capabilties###
