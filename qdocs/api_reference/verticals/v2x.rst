**Detailed Description**

This section contains APIs related to Cellular-V2X operation. The SDK has C and C++ APIs. The C APIs are legacy and are being maintained for backwards compatibility purposes. These APIs are mostly wrappers over the C++ APIs. New features and functionality will be added to C++ APIs. For anyone writing new Cv2x software, it is recommended to use the C++ APIs.
