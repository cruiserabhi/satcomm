/**
@page introduction Introduction

@section sec_purpose Purpose
The Telematics software development kit (TelSDK) is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide access to the QTI-specific hardware and software capabilities.

This document is intended to act as a reference guide for developers by providing details of the TelSDK APIs, function call flows and overview of TelSDK architecture.

@section sec_scope Scope
This document focusses on providing details of the TelSDK APIs. It assumes that the developer is familiar with Linux and C++11 programming.

@section sec_conventions Conventions
Function declarations, function names, type declarations, and code samples appear in a different font. For example,

\code
#include
\endcode

Parameter directions are indicated as follows:

\param [in] paramname   indicates an input parameter.

\param [out]  paramname indicates an output parameter.

\param [in,out]  paramname indicates a parameter used for both input and output.

Most APIs are asynchronous as underlying sub-systems such as telephony are asynchronous. API names follow the convention of using prefix " get " for synchronous calls and " request " for asynchronous calls. Asynchronous responses such as listener callbacks come on a different thread than the application thread.

@section sec_sdkversioning SDK Versioning

The following convention is used for versioning the SDK releases

<b>SDK version (major.minor.patch)</b>

SDK_VERSION = 1.0.0

<b>Major version</b>: This number will be incremented whenever significant changes or features are introduced.

<b>Minor version</b>: This number will be incremented when smaller features with some new APIs are introduced.

<b>Patch version</b>: If the release only contains bug fixes, but no API change then the patch version would be incremented, No change in the actual API interface.

<b>NOTE</b>: Use telux::common::Version::getSdkVersion() API to query the current version of SDK or refer the VERSION file in the repository

@section sec_public_API_status Public API Status

Public APIs are introduced and removed (if necessary) in phases. This allows users of an existing API that is being Deprecated to migrate. APIs will be marked with note indicating whether the API is subject to change or if it is not recommended to use the API.

as follows:

- <b>Eval</b>: This is a new API and is being evaluated. It is subject to change and could break backwards compatibility.

- <b>Obsolete</b>: API is not preferred and a better alternative is available.

- <b>Deprecated</b>: API is not going to be supported in future releases. Clients should stop using this API. Once an API has been marked as Deprecated, the API could be removed in future releases.
