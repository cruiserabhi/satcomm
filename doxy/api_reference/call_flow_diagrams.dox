@section app_initialization Application initialization call flow

Telematics-SDK initializes various sub-systems during start-up. It marks each sub-system's service status as SERVICE_AVAILABLE once the initialization procedures are completed for that sub-system. The application should pass callback function when requesting for manager object. This callback is invoked by underlying library which provides subsystem initialisation status.
The application has to wait until the corresponding sub-system callback is invoked. Application should make API requests when service status is SERVICE_AVAILABLE. Telematics-SDK provides APIs to fetch sub-system status.

Example:

@subsection phone_manager Phone manager initialization

Private eCall:
1. It is a normal VOLTE call(to a custom number) with MSD information.
2. Application processor (AP) sends the MSD data at call connect and later AP gets an explicit indication,
   upon which it can provide updated MSD(unlike standard eCall where AP updates MSD constantly)
3. Device doesn't support fallback to CS. It is the AP's responsibility to retry over CS.
4. AP can send the MSD information data in non standard format and PSAP should be able to
   recognize it.

This call flow diagram describes the sequence of steps for registering or deregistering C-V2X Rx flows using C++ version APIs.
Application must perform C-V2X radio initialization before calling any methods of ICv2xRadio.

There are three Rx modes supported for non-IP traffic,
- Wildcard Rx: Receive all service IDs on a single port. This mode could break catchall Rx and specific service ID Rx.
- Catchall Rx: Receive the specified service IDs on a single port. This mode can be used for Rx-only devices for which no Tx flow need to be created.
- Specific service ID Rx: Receive a specified service ID on a single port. Application can receive different service IDs on different ports by registering a pair of Tx and Rx flows for each service ID.

<b>NOTE:</b> For catchall or specific service ID Rx mode, filtering for received broadcast packets is implemented in low layer based on the service ID and its mapped destination L2 address, assuming that each service ID is mapped to a unique destination L2 address for all Tx and Rx devices. If this assumption is not valid, for example, in ETSI standards all broadcast service IDs are using same destination L2 address 0xFFFFFFFF, then application should choose wildcard Rx method and do filtering in application layer.

1. Application requests to enable wildcard Rx mode by specifying no service ID when creating Rx flow.
2. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request for creating Rx flow was sent successfully.
3. C-V2X radio sends asynchronous notification via the callback function on the status of the request for creating Rx flow. If SUCCESS, the RX flow is returned in the callback.
4. Application requests to enable catchall Rx mode by specifying a valid service ID list when creating Rx flow.
5. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request for creating Rx flow was sent successfully.
6. C-V2X radio sends asynchronous notification via the callback function on the status of the request for creating Rx flow. If SUCCESS, the RX flow is returned in the callback.
7. Application requests to create a Tx event flow before creating Rx flow to enable specific service ID Rx mode. The service ID and the port number of Tx and Rx flow should be the same.
8. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request for creating Tx flow was sent successfully.
9. C-V2X radio sends asynchronous notification via the callback function on the status of creating Tx flow. If SUCCESS, the TX event flow is returned in the callback.
10. Application requests to enable specific service ID Rx mode if the corresponding Tx flow has been registered successfully.
11. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request for creating Rx flow was sent successfully.
12. C-V2X radio sends asynchronous notification via the callback function on the status of the request for creating Rx flow. If SUCCESS, the RX flow is returned in the callback.
13. Application requests to closes the Tx event flow registered for specific service ID Rx mode.
14. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request for closing Tx flow was sent successfully.
15. C-V2X radio sends asynchronous notification via the callback function on the status of closing Tx flow.
16. Application requests to close the RX flow.
17. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request for closing Rx flow was sent successfully.
18. C-V2X radio sends asynchronous notification via the callback (if a callback was specified) indicating the status of closing Rx flow.

@section tcuactivity_management_call_flow TCU Activity Management

 * An application can get the appropriate TCU-activity manager (i.e. slave or master) object from the power factory.
 * The TCU-activity manager configured as the master is responsible for triggering state transitions.
 * TCU-activity manager configured as a slave is responsible for listening to state change indications and acknowledging when it performs necessary tasks and prepares for the state transition.
 * A machine in this power management framework represents an application processor subsystem or a host/guest virtual machine on hypervisor based platforms.
 *
 * - Only one master is allowed in the system, and currently we only support allowing the master on the primary/host machine and not on the guest virtual machine.
 * - It is expected that all processes interested in a TCU-activity state change should register as slaves.
 * - When the master changes the TCU-activate state, slaves connected to the impacted machine are notified.
 * - Master can trigger the TCU-activity state change of a specific machine or all machines at once.
 * - If the slave wants to differentiate between a state change indication that is the result of a trigger for all machines or a trigger for its specific machines, it can be detected using the machine name provided in the listener API.
 * - When the master triggers an all machines TCU-activity state change, only the machines that are not in the desired state will undergo the state transition, and the slaves to those machines will be notified.
 * - In the case of 
 *   - suspend or shutdown trigger: 
 *      - After becoming ready for state change, all slave clients should acknowledge back.
 *      - The master client will get notification about the consolidated acknowledgement status of all slave clients.
 *      - On getting a successful consolidated acknowledgement from all the slaves for the suspend trigger, the power framework allows the respective machine to suspend. On getting a successful consolidated acknowledgement from all the slaves for the shutdown trigger, the power framework triggers the respective machine shutdown without waiting further.
 *      - If the slave client sends a NACK to indicate that it is not ready for state transition or fails to acknowledge before the configured time, then the master will get to know via a consolidated acknowledgement / slave acknowledgement status notification.
 *      - In such failed cases, if the master wants to stop the state transition considering the information in the consolidated acknowledgement, then the master is allowed to trigger a new TCU-activity state change, or else the state transition will proceed after the configured timeout.
 *   - resume trigger:
 *      - Power framework will prevent the respective machine from going into suspend.
 *      - No acknowledgement will be required from slave clients and the master will not be getting consolidated acknowledgement / slave acknowledgement as machine will be already resumed. 
 *
 * When the application is notified about the service being unavailable, the TCU-activity state notifications will be inactive. After the service becomes available, the existing listener registrations will be maintained.

1. Application requests power factory for TCU-activity manager object, with clientType as slave. slave clients set up to listen to their LOCAL_MACHINE. Also, it is recommended to give a unique name to each slave client so that client can be identified later in case of failure.
2. Power factory returns ITcuActivityManager object using which application will register or remove a listener.
3. Wait for the TCU-activity management services to be ready.
4. Application can register a listener for getting notifications on TCU-activity state updates on the machine. Some of the listener APIs are designed for slave clients and others for master clients. Listener APIs intended for the master client will not be sent to the slave client, and listner APIs intended for the slave client will not be sent for the master client.
5. Status of register listener i.e. either SUCCESS or FAILED will be returned to the application.
6. Application will get TCU-activity state notifications like suspend, resume and shutdown.
7. Application will send one acknowledgement, after processing(save any required information) suspend/shutdown notifications. This indicates the readiness of application for state-transition. However the TCU-activity management service doesn't wait for acknowledgement indefinitely, before performing the state transition. In the acknowledgement, slave can specify the machine name received in the notification in the previous step.
8. Application receives synchronous status which indicates if the acknowledgement was sent successfully.
9. Application can remove listener.

@section sensor_callflow Sensor

The sensor sub-system provides APIs to configure and acquire continuous stream of data from an

1. Get the reference to the SensorFactory, with which we can further acquire other sensor sub-system
objects.
2. Prepare an initialization callback method or lambda which will be called by the sensor sub-system
once the initialization is complete.
3. Request for the SensorManager from SensorFactory and provide the initalization callback. Retain
the SensorManager shared_ptr as long as necessary. SensorFactory does not hold on to the returned
instance. If the received shared_ptr is released, SensorManager would be destroyed and requesting
SensorFactory for SensorManager again would result in the creation of a new instance. Similar is the
approach for SensorFeatureManager.
4. Wait for the initialization callback to be invoked.
5. The sensor sub-system invokes the callback once the underlying sub-system and sensor framework is
available for usage. If the service status is notified as SERVICE_FAILED, retry intitialization
starting with step (3). If the service status is notified as SERVICE_AVAILABLE, the sensor
sub-system is ready for usage.

The sensor sub-system should have been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE as a
pre-requisite for sensor data acquisition and a valid SensorManager object is available.
1. Get the information about available sensors from ISensorManager. The information will be provided
in the sensorInfo parameter that would be passed by reference.
2. Given the information about different sensors, identify the required sensor (name of the sensor)
using the provided attributes - type, name, vendor or required sampling frequency. Having identified the required sensor,
request for the sensor object from ISensorManager with the required name of the sensor. If the request
was successful, the provided reference to shared_ptr<ISensorClient> would be set by the ISensorManager
which can be used to further configure and acquire data from the sensor. The ownership of the
sensor object is with the application. SensorManager does not hold a reference to the returned
instance. So, requesting ISensorManager for a sensor with the same name would result in a new
sensor object being returned.
3. Create a listener of type ISensorEventListener which would receive notifications about updates
to sensor configuration and sensor events. Register the created listener with the sensor object.
4. Create the desired sensor configuration. For continous data acquisition samplingRate and
batchCount are necessary attributes to be set in the configuration. Be sure to set the validityMask
in the SensorConfiguration structure.
5. On successful configuration, a notification is sent to the registered listeners indicating the
configuration set.
6. Activate the sensor for acquiring sensor data.
7. When the sensor is activated successfully, the sensor data is sent to the registered listeners.

When the sensor sub-system has been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE and is already
activated, reconfiguring the sensors involves the following steps.
1. Deactivate the sensor. This will stop the notifications about sensor events to the registered
listeners.
2. Configure the sensor with the required attributes. Be sure to set the validityMask for the all
required attributes in SensorConfiguration.
3. The underlying sub-system notifies the registered listeners about the new configuration set.
4. Activate the sensor.
5. When the sensor is activated successfully, the sensor data is sent to the registered listeners
as per the new configuration.

When the sensor sub-system has been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE and sensor
objects have been created, the following steps ensure a cleanup of the sensor sub-system.
1. Deactivate all the sensors. With this, the registered listeners will no longer be notified of the
sensor events.

The below points are to be noted for sensor power control
a) Power control is not offered by all sensor manufacturers. If the underlying hardware sensor does
not support power control, the power control APIs fail.
b) Enabling or disabling low power mode for the sensor is only possible when the sensor is not
activated.

For achieving power control, the following steps are to be followed
1. Deactivate the sensor. This will stop the notifications about sensor events to the registered
listeners.
2. Perform the required power control by enabling or disabling low power mode for the sensor.
3. Activate the sensor.
4. When the sensor is activated successfully, the sensor data is sent to the registered listeners.

The sensor sub-system offers certain features in addition to the data acquisition and these could be
features offered by the underlying sensor hardware or the sensor software framework. If there are no
features offered collectively, the sensor feature manager initialization would fail.

1. Retrieve a list of features offered by the sensor sub-system and identify the required feature
that needs to be enabled. If the feature that needs to be enabled is known, this step is optional.
2. Create a sensor feature event listener, which would be notified of the different events that
occur. Register this listener with the sensor feature manager.
3. Enable the required feature.
4. If system is not in sleep mode, Once the feature is enabled and an event related to the feature occurs, the listener is notified.
5. If system is in sleep mode, Once the feature is enabled and an event related to the feature occurs, the listener is notified.

@section platform_callflow Platform

The platform sub-system provides APIs to configure and control platform functionalities.
This sub-system provides notifications about certain system related events, for instance filesystem
events such as EFS restore and backup events.

1. Get the reference to the PlatformFactory, with which we can further acquire other sub-system
objects.
2. Prepare an initialization callback method or lambda which will be called by the platform
sub-system once the initialization is complete.
3. Request for the IFsManager (filesystem manager) object from PlatformFactory and provide the
initalization callback. Retain the IFsManager shared_ptr as long as necessary. PlatformFactory does
not hold on to the returned instance. If the received shared_ptr is released, FsManager would be
destroyed and requesting PlatformFactory for FsManager again would result in the creation of a new
instance.
4. Wait for the initialization callback to be invoked. The platform sub-system invokes the callback
once the underlying sub-system is available for usage. If the service status is notified as
SERVICE_FAILED, retry intitialization starting with step (3). If the service status is notified as
SERVICE_AVAILABLE, the filesystem manager is ready for usage.
5. Create an listener object of type IFsListener and register with IFsManager for notifications.
Once registered, the listener receives service status notifications and EFS restore event
notifications.
6. If a service status notification with status SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, the application should wait
for service to be re-initialized and once done, SERVICE_AVAILABLE will be notified. If the service
fails, SERVICE_FAILED is notified and the IFsManager object held is no longer usable. A new object
of type IFsManager needs to be re-acquired from the PlatformFactory.
7. When the application finds it appropriate to trigger a EFS backup, startEfsBackup should be
invoked, which would return immediately indicating the status of the request
8. Once EFS backup starts and completes, the notifications are sent out to the application.
EFS restoration is controlled by the internal components based on several factors like
identification of critical filesystem errors which result in failure to boot. When such conditions
are identified, EFS restore events would be received by the application via the OnEfsRestoreEvent
method and the application can make use of the information appropriately. The EFS restore
notification also has information if the restore started or ended and if the restore was successful
or a failure.
9. Once clean-up is necessary, deregister the registered listener, set all shared pointers to
nullptr. This will make the underlying sub-system relinquish resources that are no longer
necessary.

Certain sensors offer self test feature which can be invoked whenever needed by the application
using the selfTest API. The sensor sub-system should have been initialized successfully with
SERVICE_AVAILABLE as a pre-requisite for sensor data acquisition and a valid SensorManager object
is available.
1. Get the information about available sensors from ISensorManager. The information will be provided
in the sensorInfo parameter that would be passed by reference.
2. Given the information about different sensors, identify the required sensor (name of the sensor)
using the provided attributes - type, name, vendor or required sampling frequency. Having identified the required sensor,
request for the sensor object from ISensorManager with the required name of the sensor. If the request
was successful, the provided reference to shared_ptr<ISensorClient> would be set by the ISensorManager
which can be used to further configure and acquire data from the sensor. The ownership of the
sensor object is with the application. SensorManager does not hold a reference to the returned
instance. So, requesting ISensorManager for a sensor with the same name would result in a new
sensor object being returned.
3. Trigger the self test with the require self test type and provide a callback that would be
invoked by the sensor framework once the self test is completed.
4. Once the self test is completed, the callback gets invoked indicating the result of the self

1. Application requests IWlanDeviceManager object from WLAN factory.
2. WLAN factory returns shared pointer to IWlandeviceManager to the application.
3. Application can use IWlanDeviceManager::getServiceStatus to determine if the system is ready.
4. The application receives the Status i.e. either SERVICE_AVAILABLE or SERVICE_UNAVALABLE to indicate whether sub-system is ready or not.
   5. If subsystem is not ready, then the application could wait for callback provided in step 1 for subsystem initialization status.
   6. Application pprovided callback is invoked with subsystem status (SERVICE_AVAILABLE/SERVICE_FAILED).
7. On Readiness, requests IApInterfaceManager object from WLAN factory.
8. WLAN factory returns shared pointer to IApInterfaceManager to the application.
9. Application calls IApInterfaceManager::setConfig to set desired IP configurations.
10. Application receives response set configuration.
11. Application calls IApInterfaceManager::managerApService to restart hostapd daemon.
12. Application receives response to restart hostapd daemon and access point configuration shall be active at this stage.
